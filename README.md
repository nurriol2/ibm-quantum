# IBM Quantum Challenge #

From IBM Quantum Experience challenge page

*"We would like to invite you to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the IBM Quantum Experience with 4 quantum programming exercises to solve in 4 days."*

To best prepare for this event, I will be...

[] reviewing theory from M. Nielsen and I. Chuang (2010)</br>
[] learning the Qiskit module from qiskit.org/textbook</br>
[] experimenting with some problems I find interesting </br>
